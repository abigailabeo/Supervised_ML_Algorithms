# Supervised_ML_Algorithms
In this repository, I will show how to implement some supervised machine learning algorithms from scratch, putting them in a class and being able to create objects of them. 

Some algorithms you will see include:
Logistic Regression, 
Stochastic Gradient Descent, 
Batch Gradient Descent, 
Mini-Batch Gradient Descent, 
K-Nearest Neighbors, 
Perceptron, 
Locally Weighted Linear Regression.
